I'm a creative and marketing professional.

I have worn several hats throughout my career, thus gaining the experience and skills to develop sound solutions in various areas. I can take your projects from thumbnails to final printed deliverables, from marketing strategy to execution of successful marketing plans, or from creative briefs to web designs that bring real results. I am a true problem solver who welcomes challenges and enjoys collaboration. 

I'm looking for a new opportunity that would best match my skillset.
